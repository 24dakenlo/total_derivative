This is a tutorial of freshman-level mathematics in a university.
It is about "total derivative", which is somehow a difficult idea for some students who cannot make an imagination of 3-D structure. By letting them make a hand-made papercraft moel of the 3-D imagination, it helps them understand the idea.
